(* Simple Standard ML JSON parser
   ==============================
   https://hg.sr.ht/~cannam/sml-simplejson
   An RFC-compliant JSON parser in one SML file with no dependency 
   on anything outside the Basis library. Also includes a simple
   serialiser.
   Tested with MLton, Poly/ML, and SML/NJ compilers.
   Parser notes:
   * Complies with RFC 7159, The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
     Data Interchange Format
   * Passes all of the JSONTestSuite parser accept/reject tests that
     exist at the time of writing, as listed in "Parsing JSON is a
     Minefield" (http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php)
 
   * Two-pass parser using naive exploded strings, therefore not
     particularly fast and not suitable for large input files
   * Only supports UTF-8 input, not UTF-16 or UTF-32. Doesn't check
     that JSON strings are valid UTF-8 -- the caller must do that --
     but does handle \u escapes
   * Converts all numbers to type "real". If that is a 64-bit IEEE
     float type (common but not guaranteed in SML) then we're pretty
     standard for a JSON parser
   * For simplicity this implementation returns object fields in the
     order in which they appear in the input, without checking for
     duplicates. But JSON object fields are unordered, so callers
     should take care not to accidentally rely on this
